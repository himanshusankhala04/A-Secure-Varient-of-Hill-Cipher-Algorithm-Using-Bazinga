# A-Secure-Varient-of-Hill-Cipher-Algorithm-Using-Bazinga

In Hill cipher there is a constant substitution performed on chunks of data , it is developed on linear algebra. The major drawbacks of Hill cipher are that it is vulnerable to a known-plaintext attack and  the unreliability of whether the key matrix is invertible for decryption. The proposed algorithm includes a key generation using python secrets library which will always generate a random and valid key, there are two phases of padding and by applying a two level bit manipulation algorithm (Bazinga), it overcomes the flaws of the traditional Hill cipher, based on real testing and experiments the avalanche score increases to 54.7%.
