# A-Secure-Varient-of-Hill-Cipher-Algorithm-Using-Bazinga
Hill Cipher Algorithm with randomness. 
Cryptography is a very Effective tool that allows sharing of data while maintaining the Integrity and Confidentiality of the messages. It also protects the information from any type of theft, manipulation and modification. Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher developed on Linear algebra. However, it could be vulnerable  to a known-plaintext attack and another big drawback of hill cipher is the unreliability of whether the key matrix is invertible for decryption. The proposed method includes a key generation using python secrets library which will always generate a random and valid key, there are two phases of padding and by applying a two level bit manipulation algorithm (Bazinga), it overcomes the flaws of the traditional Hill Cipher, test confirm based on real experiment, the avalanche score increases to 54.7%
